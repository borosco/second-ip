              <p>Children are considered to be a gift from God in Ghana. 
                  The birth of a child is therefore a very joyous and important occasion 
                  in the life of the parents and the community at large, and the naming ceremony 
                  is usually carried out with much celebration.

                  At birth, the child is given a day name based upon the gender and
                   day of the week on which the child was born.</p>
